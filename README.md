# NFL QB Performance
 As an avid fan of fantasy football, I always have a tough time deciding which quarterback to start or bench. Aside from their average stats, there are other things to consider - such as the opponent's defensive strength, gameday weather, etc.
 
 For my grad school project, we used machine learning classification algorithms to predict a QB's performance (e.g. "really good", "average", "really poor", etc.) based on various predictors. For our project, we had used Weka for modeling different algorithms paired with different attribute selection algorithms. For results, you may read our final [report](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/omshapira/NFL_QB_Performance/blob/master/Reports/Final_Report.pdf), our download our [presentation](https://github.com/omshapira/NFL_QB_Performance/blob/master/Reports/Presentation.pptx) of summarized findings.
 
I am currently in the process of exploring other ML algorithms in Python, along with some additional visualizations. The data pre-processing was performed in R, and can be found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/omshapira/NFL_QB_Performance/blob/master/Data_Scrubbing_R/NFL_QB_Data_Scrubbing.html). I had pulled from several different source datasets to perform this analysis.

Stay tuned for more updates...
